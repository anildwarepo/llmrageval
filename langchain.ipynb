       "[Document(page_content='NVP/SOAP API /\\n\\nGet Started /\\n\\nNVP Basics\\n\\nPayPal NVP API Basics\\n\\nAPILegacy\\n\\nThe Name-Value Pair (NVP) API provides parameter-based association between the request and response fields of a message and their values. The request message is sent from your website by the API, and a response message is returned by PayPal using a client-server model in which your site is a client of the PayPal server. NVP describes the format of the request and response messages that you send to and receive from the PayPal API. An example of a name-value pair is <FieldName>=<Value>, where <FieldName> is the name of the PayPal API field and <Value> is the information that you pass to or receive from the PayPal API, such as, VERSION=200.\\n\\nNote: The PayFlow API also uses name-value pairs to provide parameter-based association between request and response fields of a message and their values; however, the PayFlow API is not the same as the NVP API; for more information about the PayFlow API, see the Payflow Gateway Developer Guide and Reference.\\n\\nPayPal API client-server architecture\\n\\nThe PayPal API uses a client-server model. Your website is a client of the PayPal server.\\n\\nA page on your website initiates an action on a PayPal API server by sending a request to the server. The PayPal server responds with a confirmation that the requested action was taken or indicates that an error occurred. The response might also contain additional information related to the request. The following diagram shows the basic request-response mechanism.\\n\\nFor example, you might want to get the customer\\'s shipping address from PayPal. You can initiate an API request to get customer details. The response from the PayPal API server contains information about whether the request was successful. If the operation succeeds, the response contains the requested information. In this case, the response contains the customer\\'s shipping address. If the operation fails, the response contains one or more error messages.\\n\\nPayPal Name-Value Pair API requests and responses\\n\\nTo complete a PayPal NVP API operation, send an NVP-formatted request to a PayPal NVP server and interpret the response.\\n\\nIn this diagram, your website generates a request. The request runs on a PayPal server and the response is returned to your site.\\n\\nThe request identifies:\\n\\nThe name of the API operation, specified by METHOD=API-Operation-Name, to be performed and its version.Note: After the METHOD parameter, you can specify the other parameters in any order.\\n\\nAPI Credentials that identify the PayPal account making the request.\\n\\nRequest-specific information that controls the API operation to be performed.\\n\\nA PayPal API server completes the operation and returns a response.\\n\\nThe response contains:\\n\\nAn acknowledgment (ACK) status that indicates whether the operation succeeded or failed and whether any warning messages were returned.\\n\\nInformation that can be used by PayPal to track execution of the API operation, such as the transaction ID.\\n\\nResponse-specific information required to fulfill the request.\\n\\nUTF-8 character encoding\\n\\nThe PayPal API assumes that all request data is in Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) Transformation Format – 8-bit encoding form (UTF-8).\\n\\nThe API always returns data in UTF-8.\\n\\nMultiple API operations\\n\\nSome features, such as Express Checkout, require that you to call multiple API operations.\\n\\nTypically, these features require you to:\\n\\nInvoke an API operation, such as SetExpressCheckout. This API operation sets up the return URL to which PayPal redirects your customer\\'s browser after the buyer completes the payment on the PayPal website. Other setup actions also can be performed by this API operation.\\n\\nInvoke additional API operations after receiving the customer\\'s permission on PayPal, for example, GetExpressCheckoutDetails or DoExpressCheckoutPayment.\\n\\nThe following diagram shows the execution flow between your website and PayPal:\\n\\nToken usage\\n\\nTypically, the API operation that sets up a redirection to PayPal (SetExpressCheckout) returns a token. This token is passed as a parameter in the redirect to PayPal. The token also might be required in related API operations.\\n\\nNVP format\\n\\nNVP specifies names and values in a string. NVP is the informal name for the query in the URI specification. The NVP string is appended to the URL.\\n\\nAn NVP string conforms to these guidelines:\\n\\nThe name is separated from the value by an equal sign (=). For example: FIRSTNAME=Robert\\n\\nName-value pairs are separated by an ampersand (&). For example: FIRSTNAME=Robert&MIDDLENAME=Herbert&LASTNAME=Moore\\n\\nEach value in an NVP string is URL-encoded.\\n\\nCreate an NVP request\\n\\nThe Name-Value Pair request format specifies the API operation to perform, credentials that authorize PayPal to access your account, and fields containing additional information to be used in the request.\\n\\nSpecify the PayPal API operation\\n\\nFor the NVP version of the PayPal API, you must specify the name of the PayPal API operation to execute in each request along with the version of the API operation.\\n\\nThe following diagram shows the API operation part of an NVP request:\\n\\nA method specifies the PayPal operation you want to execute, and each method is associated with a version. Together, the method and version define the exact behavior of the API operation. Typically, the behavior of an API operation does not change between versions; however, you should carefully retest your code whenever you change a version.\\n\\nTo specify a method and version number:\\n\\nChoose the PayPal API operation you want to use. METHOD=API-Operation-Name\\n\\nChoose the appropriate version. In most cases, you should use the latest version of the API operation. VERSION=API-Version-Number\\n\\nUse API signature credentials\\n\\nYou must specify API credentials in each request to execute a PayPal API operation. You can use either a signature or a certificate, but not both.\\n\\nWhen you execute a PayPal API operation, you use credentials, such as a signature, to authenticate that you are requesting the API operation. The following diagram shows the API credentials part of an NVP request:\\n\\nImportant: You must protect the values for USER, PWD, and SIGNATURE in your implementation. Consider storing these values in a secure location other than your web server document root and setting the file permissions so that only the system user that executes your ecommerce application can access it.\\n\\nTo enable PayPal to authenticate your request:\\n\\nSpecify the API username associated with your account. USER=API-Username\\n\\nSpecify the password associated with the API user name. PWD=API-Password\\n\\nIf you are using an API signature and not an API certificate, specify the API signature associated with the API username. SIGNATURE=API-Signature\\n\\nIf you\\'re calling the API on behalf of a third-party merchant, you must specify the email address on file with PayPal of the third-party merchant or the merchant\\'s account ID (sometimes called Payer ID). SUBJECT=Authorizing-Merchant-Email Or Authorizing-Merchant-Account-IDNote: Third-party merchants can look up their merchant ID by logging into https://www.paypal.com, clicking the profile icon () on the top right side of the page and then selecting Profile and settings in the Business Profile menu. (If you do not see a profile icon at the top of the page, click Profile, which appears in the top menu when the My Account tab is selected.) Click My business info on the left, and the Merchant account ID is displayed in the list of profile items on the right.Typically, a merchant grants third-party permissions to a shopping cart, so the shopping cart can call the API on the merchant\\'s behalf. The merchant must have previously granted you permission to execute the API operation.\\n\\nSpecify credentials with cURL\\n\\nThe following example shows one way to specify a signature using cURL:\\n\\nNote: Because this example does not establish a secure connection, do not use it in the live environment.\\n\\nURL encoding\\n\\nYou must URL-encode all HTTP requests to execute PayPal API operations. The encoding ensures that you can transmit:\\n\\nSpecial characters.\\n\\nCharacters that are not allowed in a URL.\\n\\nCharacters that have special meaning in a URL, such as the equal sign and ampersand.\\n\\nThe PayPal NVP API uses the HTTP protocol to send requests to and receive responses from a PayPal API server.\\n\\nYou must encode all data sent using the HTTP protocol because data that is not encoded can be misinterpreted as part of the HTTP protocol instead of part of the request.\\n\\nMost programming languages provide a way to encode strings in this way. You should consistently URL-encode the complete API request. Otherwise, you might find that unanticipated data causes an error.\\n\\nNote: Most browsers automatically URL-encode HTTP forms.\\n\\nFor example, this NVP string:\\n\\nIs encoded, as follows:\\n\\nEncode and decode methods for URLs\\n\\nUse these methods to URL-encode or URL-decode your NVP strings:\\n\\nLanguage Encode or decode Method ASP.NET Encode System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlEncode(buffer, Encoding.Default) Decode System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlDecode(buffer, Encoding.Default) Java Encode java.net.URLEncoder.encode Decode java.net.URLDecoder.decode PHP Encode urlencode() Decode urldecode() ColdFusion Encode URLEncodedFormatstring [, charset] Decode URLDecodeurlEncodedString[, charset])\\n\\nList syntax for name-value pairs\\n\\nThe PayPal API uses a special syntax for NVP fields defined as lists.\\n\\nThe NVP interface to the PayPal API requires a unique name for each field. In the API, lists are prefixed by L_.\\n\\nNote: Not all lists follow the L_ prefix convention. However, all lists begin at 0 for the first element.\\n\\nTo identify an element within the list, use the offset from the beginning of the list, starting with 0 as the first element. For example, since in some cases you can submit more than one payment in a single request, PAYMENTREQUEST_0_DESC is the description of the first payment in a request, PAYMENTREQUEST_1_DESC, is the description of the second payment in the request, and so on.\\n\\nAdditionally, you can pass lists within lists, which also use an offset that starts with 0 as the first element. For example, L_PAYMENTREQUEST_0_DESC0 is the description of the first item in the first payment.\\n\\nExecute NVP API operations\\n\\nYou execute a PayPal NVP API operation by submitting an HTTPS POST request to a PayPal API server, or by using cURL or another mechanism to provide secure access between the buyer\\'s browser and the PayPal API server. For example, you might implement a system in which the buyer\\'s browser remains a client of your server and your server becomes a client of the PayPal API server.\\n\\nSpecify a PayPal server\\n\\nYou execute a PayPal API operation by submitting the request to a PayPal API server.\\n\\nTo execute a PayPal NVP API operation, submit the request to one of the following endpoints:\\n\\nServer endpoint Description https://api-3t.sandbox.paypal.com/nvp The sandbox, or test, server for use with API signature credentials. https://api-3t.paypal.com/nvp The PayPal live production server for use with API signature credentials. https://api.sandbox.paypal.com/nvp The sandbox, or test, server for use with API certificate credentials. https://api.paypal.com/nvp The PayPal live production server for use with API certificate credentials.\\n\\nNote: You must use different API credentials for each server endpoint. Typically, you obtain API credentials when you test in the sandbox and then obtain another set of credentials for the production server. You must change each API request to use the new credentials when you go live.\\n\\nLog API operations\\n\\nYou must log basic information from the request and response messages of each PayPal API operation you execute. You must log the CorrelationID returned in the response message, which identifies the PayPal application that processed the request and must be provided to Merchant Technical Support if you need their assistance with a specific transaction.\\n\\nAll responses to PayPal API operations contain information that may be useful for debugging purposes. In addition to logging the Correlation ID from the response message, you can log other information, such as the transaction ID and timestamp, to enable you to review a transaction on the PayPal website or through the API. You could implement a scheme that logs the entire request and response in a \"verbose\" mode; however, you should never log the password from a request.\\n\\nRespond to an NVP response\\n\\nThe Name-Value Pair response consists of the answer to the request as well as common fields that identify the API operation and how it was executed.\\n\\nThe following diagram shows fields in the response to a PayPal NVP API operation:\\n\\nCommon response fields\\n\\nThe PayPal API always returns common fields in addition to fields that are specific to the requested PayPal API operation.\\n\\nA PayPal API response includes the following fields:\\n\\nField Description ACK Acknowledgment status, which is one of the following values: Success — A successful operation. SuccessWithWarning — A successful operation; however, there are messages returned in the response that you should examine. Failure — The operation failed; the response also contains one or more error messages explaining the failure. FailureWithWarning — The operation failed and there are messages returned in the response that you should examine. CORRELATIONID Correlation ID, which uniquely identifies the transaction to PayPal. TIMESTAMP The date and time that the requested API operation was performed in UTC/GMT format. VERSION The version of the API. BUILD The sub-version of the API.\\n\\nError responses\\n\\nIf the ACK value is not Success, the payment or desired action might fail.\\n\\nThe value of the ACK response is:\\n\\nSuccess. The request was successful.\\n\\nSuccessWithWarning. The request was successful but a warning error code was also returned.\\n\\nFailure. The API request failed. See error messages for details.\\n\\nFailureWithWarning. The API request failed and additional warning messages were returned.\\n\\nError response format\\n\\nAn error response has this format:\\n\\nResponse fields on error ACK=Failure&TIMESTAMP= Date-And-Time-Of-Response & CORRELATIONID=debuggingToken&VERSION= API-Version & BUILD=buildNumber&L_ERRORCODE0= Error-Code & L_SHORTMESSAGE0= Short-Error-Message & L_LONGMESSAGE0= Long-Error-Message & L_SEVERITYCODE0= Severity-Code Multiple errors can be returned. Each set of errors has a different numeric suffix in the field name, starting with 0 and incremented by one for each error.\\n\\nAdditional pass-through information can appear in the L_ERRORPARAMIDn and L_ERRORPARAMVALUEn fields.\\n\\nIn this error response:\\n\\nTIMESTAMP=2011%2d11%2d15T20%3a27%3a02Z&CORRELATIONID=5be53331d9700&ACK=Failure &VERSION=78%2e0&BUILD=000000&L_ERRORCODE0=15005&L_SHORTMESSAGE0=Processor%20Decline &L_LONGMESSAGE0=This%20transaction%20cannot%20be%20processed%2e&L_SEVERITYCODE0=Error &\\n\\nThe parameter ID is ProcessorResponse, which indicates an error response by a credit or debit card processor.\\n\\nThe value contains the processor-specific error.\\n\\nPayPal does not set these values. Instead, these values are passed through from the source.\\n\\nNote: PayPal only passes selected values in the L_ERRORPARAMIDn and L_ERRORPARAMVALUEn fields.\\n\\nURL decoding\\n\\nYou must URL-decode all responses to HTTP POST operations from the PayPal NVP API\\n\\nThe PayPal NVP API uses the HTTP protocol to send requests and receive responses from a PayPal API server. You must decode all data returned through the HTTP protocol so that it can be displayed properly. Most programming languages provide a way to URL-decode strings.', metadata={'source': 'https://developer.paypal.com/api/nvp-soap/NVPAPIOverview/'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"NVP/SOAP API /\\n\\nGet Started\\n\\nGet Started\\n\\nAPILegacyLast updated: October 15th 2021, @ 3:55:37 pm\\n\\nPayPal offers a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that give you the means to incorporate PayPal functionality into your website applications and mobile apps.\\n\\nThis document describes how to make calls to the PayPal NVP/SOAP API operations. Once you understand how to code calls to the PayPal APIs, use the PayPal sandbox to test your PayPal routines, as described in the PayPal sandbox Testing Guide. After you've finished testing your PayPal routines, move your application to the live PayPal environment, as described in Going Live with Your Application.\\n\\nThis guide provides the following sections to get you up and running with the PayPal APIs:\\n\\nCreating a PayPal Developer Account\\n\\nThe Components of an API Request\\n\\nPutting a Call Together\\n\\nPayPal provides two environments that support calls to their API operations:\\n\\nThe _sandbox_ is a virtual testing environment where you utilize fictitious user accounts to make calls to the PayPal operations without affecting any real PayPal users or their live PayPal accounts.\\n\\nThe _production_ environment is the live environment where the PayPal operation calls you make affect the accounts of real PayPal users.\\n\\nTo make sure you don't accidentally address the wrong environment, each environment uses a different set of API credentials and endpoints.\\n\\nCreating a PayPal Developer Account\\n\\nTo make calls to the PayPal APIs, you must have a PayPal Premier or PayPal Business account. To create a PayPal account, click the Sign Up link at the top of the main PayPal page, and follow the resulting instructions.\\n\\nAfter becoming a PayPal member, use your account log-in information to register as a PayPal Developer:\\n\\nNavigate to the Developer website and click the Log In button at the top of the page.The log-in page gives you the option of registering with your current PayPal account credentials, or signing up for a new PayPal Business account.\\n\\nLog in using your PayPal account information (your email address and your password). When you first register on the Developer website, PayPal creates a default sandbox business account. Use the sandbox account details to make test calls.\\n\\nThe Components of an API Request\\n\\nEach PayPal API call consists of a combination of the following elements:\\n\\nAPI Credentials\\n\\nService Endpoint\\n\\nCall Payload\\n\\nRequest and Response Format Types\\n\\nHTTP Headers\\n\\nThe following table gives an overview of these API call elements. See the sections below for more complete descriptions.\\n\\nCall Element Description API Credentials Many API calls require a set of values to authenticate you as the owner of a PayPal account. The NVP/SOAP API credentials are assigned to your PayPal account and consist of an API Username , an API Password , and a Signature . Some API calls (such as those in the Adaptive APIs) also require an AppID value. Service Endpoint An API request can be sent to either the sandbox endpoint or the Production endpoint. The endpoint you use depends on several conditions, such as the API operation you're calling, the environment you're addressing, and the format of your call. Call Payload Each PayPal API call has both required and optional input fields that detail the specifics of the request. Together, these input fields are termed the call payload . Call Formats PayPal supports calls made using both SOAP and non-SOAP formats. In addition, call payloads can be formatted in JSON and NVP. HTTP Headers PayPal API operations require you provide specific HTTP headers with your requests. The headers specify authentication credentials, the call request and response formats, and other information. For example, when calling either the Adaptive Payments or Adaptive Accounts APIs, you need to specify your App ID in the X-PAYPAL-APPLICATION-ID header. You specify the format of the request and response using two separate headers, X-PAYPAL-REQUEST-DATA-FORMAT and X-PAYPAL-RESPONSE-DATA-FORMAT .\\n\\nAPI Credentials\\n\\nYou must provide a valid set of API credentials when making calls to PayPal API operations. This allows PayPal to verify the account that's making the calls.\\n\\nPayPal NVP/SOAP API credentials consist of an API Username, an API Password, and a Signature, and PayPal generates a unique set of credentials for each eligible PayPal account. Your Sandbox accounts and your live PayPal Business or Premier accounts have different sets of API credentials, be sure to use the correct set when testing! On the Developer site, navigate to the Applications > Sandbox accounts page to retrieve the API credentials for your sandbox business accounts.\\n\\nIn addition to the NVP/SOAP API credentials, the Adaptive APIs also make use of an AppID value. To obtain an AppID value for use in the PayPal production environment, submit your application for review, as described in Going Live with Your Application. When testing your Adaptive API calls in the sandbox, use the following static AppID value for the sandbox:\\n\\nAPP-80W284485P519543T\\n\\nSee Creating and Managing NVP/SOAP API Credentials for more on how to generate and maintain the credentials needed to make calls to the live PayPal environment.\\n\\nService Endpoint\\n\\nAn endpoint provides the URI of the server that handles your request. Each PayPal service and operation has a unique endpoint. See the PayPal Endpoints page for a list of all the NVP/SOAP API endpoints.\\n\\nFor example, the sandbox endpoint for Express Checkout SetExpressCheckout operation is as follows:\\n\\nhttps://api.sandbox.paypal.com/nvp\\n\\nUse the sandbox endpoints during your application testing phase. After you've finished testing your application in the sandbox, move to the production environment by updating the endpoints in your application so your requests are directed to the correct PayPal production service and operation.\\n\\nWith this, if you're calling an Express Checkout operation with NVP formatting, test in the sandbox with the following endpoint:\\n\\nhttps://api-3t.sandbox.paypal.com/nvp\\n\\nOnce your testing is complete, move your application into production by updating your endpoints to the following URI:\\n\\nhttps://api-3t.paypal.com/nvp\\n\\nDon't forget that to go live, you'll also need to update your API credentials to those assigned to your live PayPal account (instead of those assigned to your virtual Sandbox accounts).\\n\\nCall Payload\\n\\nEach PayPal API call contains a payload, which is a unique set of input fields that you supply with the request. API operations have both required and optional input fields. Although you can make a basic test call with only the required input fields, your production-level applications will likely make use of optional inputs.\\n\\nFor example, an Express Checkout call requires the following input fields:\\n\\nUSER—The API User name.\\n\\nPWD—The API Password.\\n\\nSIGNATURE—The Signature.\\n\\nMETHOD—The API operation you are addressing.\\n\\nVERSION—The version of the API to which you are making your request.\\n\\nAMT—The cash amount of the transaction.\\n\\ncancelUrl—The URL address to which the user is returned if they cancel the transaction.\\n\\nreturnUrl—The URL address to which the user is returned when the complete the transaction.\\n\\nThe required fields denote the minimum set of parameters that you can include in the payload of a PayPal API operation request. Below is an example of how this payload would be formatted using name-value pairs:\\n\\nUSER=\\n\\nRequest and Response Format Types\\n\\nThe PayPal NVP/SOAP APIs support two types of request and response call formats: SOAP and non-SOAP.\\n\\nWhen using SOAP, format the payload using XML within the SOAP envelope and supply any HTTP headers as part of the envelope.\\n\\nNon-SOAP formatted calls can make use of the following types of payload formats:\\n\\nName-Value Pairs (NVP)\\n\\nExtensible Markup Language\\n\\nJavaScript object notation (Adaptive APIs only)\\n\\nHow you specify the format of your PayPal operation calls depends on the API you're using. For the Adaptive APIs (Adaptive Payments, Adaptive Accounts, Invoicing and the Permissions Service), specify the request and response formats in the HTTP headers. Other PayPal APIs require that you specify the call formats in the call payload.\\n\\nHTTP Headers\\n\\nPayPal has many services and some require that you specify a set of HTTP Headers in your calls. For example, the Adaptive Payments and Adaptive Accounts APIs require the following set of HTTP headers:\\n\\nHTTP Header Description X-PAYPAL-SECURITY-USERID The API user name. This is one of the API credentials assigned to your account. X-PAYPAL-SECURITY-PASSWORD The API password. This is one of the API credentials assigned to your account. X-PAYPAL-SECURITY-SIGNATURE The API signature. This is one of the API credentials assigned to your account. X-PAYPAL-APPLICATION-ID The sandbox contains a unique and static App ID (APP-80W284485P519543T). When you move an application into production, PayPal assigns your application a custom App ID that you need to use to key your application with the production servers. X-PAYPAL-REQUEST-DATA-FORMAT The payload format for the request. X-PAYPAL-RESPONSE-DATA-FORMAT The payload format for the response.\\n\\nBe aware that different PayPal APIs use different sets of HTTP headers (and some don't use any at all). Refer to the Developer documentation for the definitive list of HTTP headers for the PayPal operation(s) you plan to use.\\n\\nPutting a Call Together\\n\\nTo make a PayPal API call, put together all the components of the call (as described just above) into a SOAP or non-SOAP object, and execute the call.\\n\\nFor example, the following cURL command, wrapped and commented for readability, shows how the call elements are assembled to make a request to the Adaptive Accounts CreateAccount operation:\\n\\nNotice that in cURL commands, HTTP headers are specified with the -H switch.\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\nFind more information about making SOAP and Name-Value Pair calls in the following guides:\\n\\nPayPal Name-Value Pair API Basics\\n\\nPayPal SOAP API Basics\\n\\nReview the Getting Started Guides listed below to see how to make calls using the two different types of PayPal NVP/SOAP APIs (Express Checkout and Adaptive APIs):\\n\\nExpress Checkout API Getting Started Guide\\n\\nAdaptive Accounts API Getting Started Guide\", metadata={'source': 'https://developer.paypal.com/api/nvp-soap/get-started/'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='NVP/SOAP API /\\n\\nGet Started /\\n\\nSOAP Basics\\n\\nPayPal SOAP API Basics\\n\\nAPILegacyLast updated: October 12th 2021, @ 6:58:00 pm\\n\\nThe PayPal SOAP API is based on open standards known collectively as web services, which include the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Web Services Definition Language (WSDL), and the XML Schema Definition language (XSD). A wide range of development tools on a variety of platforms support web services.\\n\\nLike many web services, PayPal SOAP is a combination of client-side and server-side schemas, hardware and software servers, and core services.\\n\\nIn an object-oriented processing model, the interface to SOAP requests/responses is an object in your application\\'s native programming language. Your third-party SOAP client generates business-object interfaces and network stubs from PayPal-provided WSDL and XSD files that specify the PayPal SOAP message structure, its contents, and the PayPal API service bindings. A business application works with data in the form of object properties to send and receive data by calling object methods. The SOAP client handles the details of building the SOAP request, sending it to the PayPal service, and converting the response back to an object.\\n\\nPayPal WSDL/XSD Schema Definitions\\n\\nThe PayPal Web Services schema and its underlying eBay Business Language (eBL) base and core components are required for developing applications with the PayPal Web Services API. The following are the locations of the WSDL and XSD files.\\n\\nDevelopment and Testing with the PayPal sandbox PayPal Schema https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/wsdl/PayPalSvc.wsdl eBL Base Components and Component Types https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/wsdl/eBLBaseComponents.xsd https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/wsdl/CoreComponentTypes.xsd Production with the Live PayPal API PayPal Schema https://www.paypal.com/wsdl/PayPalSvc.wsdl eBL Base Components and Component Types https://www.paypal.com/wsdl/eBLBaseComponents.xsd https://www.paypal.com/wsdl/CoreComponentTypes.xsd\\n\\nPayPal SOAP API Definitions\\n\\nThe PayPal SOAP API comprises individual API definitions for specific business functions. As a foundation, the API relies on eBay Business Language (eBL) base and core components. The core eBL structures AbstractRequestType and AbstractResponseType are the basis of the SOAP request and response of each PayPal API. AbstractResponseType is also the framework for error messages common across all PayPal APIs.\\n\\nPayPal has made some schema design decisions that can affect how businesses design their own applications.\\n\\nEnumerations — Enumerations are defined directly in the PayPal API schema.\\n\\nTroubleshooting information — The PayPal API returns information about elements that trigger errors.\\n\\nBackward compatibility — The PayPal API is versioned so that business applications are backward compatible when new elements are introduced to the server-side schema.\\n\\nNote: eBL defines many structures that are specific to processing auctions. PayPal\\'s SOAP schema includes these definitions to maintain compatibility with eBay\\'s SOAP. The material focuses only on those SOAP definitions pertinent to use of the PayPal SOAP API.\\n\\nSecurity\\n\\nThe PayPal SOAP API service is protected to ensure that only authorized PayPal members use it.

(If the profile icon at the top of the page is not visible, click Profile, which appears in the top menu when the My Account tab is selected.) Click My business info on the left, and the Merchant account ID is displayed in the list of profile items on the right.Typically, a merchant grants third-party permissions to a shopping cart, so the shopping cart can call the API on the merchant\\'s behalf.

Signature API-Signature Your API signature , if you use one instead of an API Certificate. Subject Authorizing-Merchant-Email or Authorizing-Merchant-Account-ID The email address or merchant account ID (sometimes called Payer ID) of a third-party for whom you are sending requests to the PayPal SOAP API.

See RequesterCredentials for more information. 8 The Signature element should include your API Signature if that is the type of API credential you are using. 9 The Subject element should be included when using third-party permissions (performing transactions on behalf of another merchant who authorized you to do so). Pass the authorizing third-party\\'s merchant account ID (sometimes called Payer ID) or email address. 13 through 20 The SOAP request for every PayPal API follows this element-naming pattern. The API\\'s specific name is appended with Req , and in this element the Specific-API-Name -Req is nested. Each Specific-API-Name -Request has a corresponding Specific-API-Name -RequestType . 16 The number of the PayPal SOAP API version is required on each SOAP request. This version number is the value of ns:version in https://www.paypal.com/wsdl/PayPalSvc.wsdl . 17 For details about required and optional elements and values for specific requests, see the API references .\\n\\nSOAP Message Style: doc-literal\\n\\nPayPal uses doc-literal SOAP messaging, not rpc-encoding. With doc-literal, a single service interface call passes an XML document in the request to the PayPal API server, which responds with an XML document instance.\\n\\nResponse Structure\\n\\nThe following is an annotated description of the structure of a successful SOAP response from the PayPal API where Ack=Success:\\n\\nLines Comment 10 - 17 The Specific-API-Operation-Name - Response start and end elements. An example of an API operation is SetExpressCheckout . See the NVP/SOAP API reference for a complete list. 11 Each API response contains a Timestamp with its date and time in UTC/GMT format. 12 The acknowledgment ( Ack ) element contains the string Success indicating the corresponding request was successfully processed. When there\\'s an error, Ack is set to a value other than Success , and the response body contains an Errors element with information to help you troubleshoot the cause of the error. See Error Responses for more information. 14 The CorrelationID element contains information about the PayPal application that processed the request. Use the value of this element if you need to troubleshoot a problem with one of your requests. 16 The different PayPal APIs return different elements depending on their response definitions. For detailed information, see the descriptions in the API reference . Note: Because a field is defined in the formal structure of an API response, this does not mean that the field is necessarily returned. Data is returned in a response only if PayPal has recorded data that corresponds to the field.\\n\\nError Responses\\n\\nIf the Ack value is not Success, the payment or desired action may not go through.\\n\\nPossible values of the Ack response field are the following:\\n\\nSuccess — The request was successful.\\n\\nSuccessWithWarning — The request was successful but a warning error code was also returned.\\n\\nFailure — The API request failed. See error messages for details.\\n\\nFailureWithWarning — The API request failed and additional warning messages were returned.\\n\\nIf a request is malformed or contains some other error, the body of the SOAP response contains an Errors element with other elements that can help you troubleshoot the cause of the error.\\n\\nThe structure of error messages is as follows:\\n\\nThe most important of these additional elements are as follows:\\n\\nShortMessage\\n\\nLongMessage\\n\\nErrorCode\\n\\nNote: PayPal only passes selected values in ErrorParametersType.\\n\\nThe following example shows the error response if your API username and password do not match a legitimate API username and password on file with PayPal.\\n\\nExample of the SOAP Error Response: Bad Username or Password\\n\\nCorrelationID for Reporting Problems to PayPal\\n\\nThe value returned in CorrelationID is important for PayPal to determine the precise cause of any error you might encounter. If you have to troubleshoot a problem with your requests, we suggest that you capture the value of CorrelationID so you can report it to PayPal.\\n\\nUTF-8 Character Encoding\\n\\nThe PayPal API assumes that all data in requests is in Unicode, specifically, the Unicode (or UCS) Transformation Format, 8-bit encoding form (UTF-8).\\n\\nIn responses, the API always returns data in UTF-8.\\n\\nDate/Time Formats\\n\\nThe PayPal SOAP API schema defines date/time values as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC/GMT), using ISO 8601 format, and of type ns:dateTime.\\n\\nAn example date/time stamp is 2006-08-24T05:38:48Z\\n\\nCore Currency Amount Data Type\\n\\nThe core currency amount data type is called BasicAmountType and is derived from string. All currency amount fields have the following structure:\\n\\nThe currencyID attribute is required.\\n\\nThe amount must have two decimal places, except in the case of currencies that do not support decimal amounts.\\n\\nThe decimal separator must be a period (\".\").\\n\\nYou must not use any thousands separator.\\n\\nBasicAmountType has a data type of ebl:CurrencyCodeType, which defines a large number of different currency codes. However, for your processing to succeed, you must set currencyCode to a valid currency code.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nThe field name, Amount, is an example; actual field names can vary depending on the specific API operation.', metadata={'source': 'https://developer.paypal.com/api/nvp-soap/PayPalSOAPAPIArchitecture/'}),\n",

The request message is sent from your website by the API, and a response message is returned by PayPal using a client-server model in which your site is a client of the PayPal server. NVP describes the format of the request and response messages that you send to and receive from the PayPal API. An example of a name-value pair is <FieldName>=<Value>, where <FieldName> is the name of the PayPal API field and <Value> is the information that you pass to or receive from the PayPal API, such as, VERSION=200.',\n",

Your website is a client of the PayPal server.\\n\\nA page on your website initiates an action on a PayPal API server by sending a request to the server.

       "\"To use the PayPal API in a client-server model, you would typically follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Set up your website as a client**: Your website will act as the client that communicates with the PayPal server. This involves having a page or service on your website that initiates PayPal API calls.\\n\\n2. **Initiate an action**: A page or service on your website sends a request to the PayPal API server to initiate an action, such as processing a payment or querying transaction details.\\n\\n3. **Send a request to the PayPal server**: This request is typically an HTTPS POST request that includes the necessary PayPal API operation details. If you are using the NVP API, your request would contain name-value pairs that provide the parameters and their values for the operation you want to execute.\\n\\n4. **Use secure access**: Ensure that the communication between your client (the website) and the PayPal server is secure. You can use mechanisms like cURL or other libraries that support HTTPS to perform this step.\\n\\n5. **Handle the response**: Once the PayPal server receives the request, it processes the action and responds back to your client. The response will confirm whether the requested action was taken or if there was an error. Additionally, the response may contain further information related to the request.\\n\\n6. **Process the response on your website**: Your website should be equipped to interpret the response from the PayPal server and take appropriate action. This could involve updating the user interface, adjusting database records, or triggering additional workflows based on the outcome of the API call.\\n\\nFor more detailed instructions, including how to work with the PayPal NVP/SOAP APIs, it is advisable to refer to the 'Express Checkout API Getting Started Guide' and the 'Adaptive Accounts API Getting Started Guide' provided in the PayPal developer documentation. These guides will contain step-by-step instructions, including how to authenticate, how to structure your requests, and how to handle responses from the PayPal server. Additionally, for SOAP-based interactions, you may need to use PayPal-provided WSDL and XSD files to generate the appropriate business-object interfaces and network stubs in your application's native programming language.\""

Below is a simplified outline of the process, assuming you already have your application name and client ID from PayPal:\\n\\n1. **Create a PayPal Developer Account**: Before you start, you need to sign up for a PayPal Developer account if you haven\\'t already. This will give you access to the PayPal sandbox environment for testing.\\n\\n2. **Get API Credentials**: Once you have a developer account, you can obtain your API credentials, which include your API username, password, and signature.\\n\\n3. **Set Up Your Development Environment**: Make sure you have Java and an IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) installed on your machine to write and execute your Java code.\\n\\n4. **Download PayPal Java SDK**: Download the SDK for Java provided by PayPal. This SDK will facilitate communication with the PayPal API.\\n\\n5. **Write Your Java Program**:\\n   - Import necessary classes from the PayPal SDK.\\n   - Initialize the SDK with your API credentials.\\n   - Create a checkout request using NVP parameters.\\n   - Send the request to PayPal\\'s API endpoint.\\n   - Handle the response to check if the checkout was successful.\\n\\nHere\\'s a very basic example of what the main parts of your Java code might look like (note that this is a conceptual example and will not run without the actual SDK and proper API credentials):\\n\\n```java\\nimport com.paypal.sdk.core.nvp.*;\\nimport com.paypal.sdk.services.NVPCallerServices;\\n\\npublic class PayPalHelloWorld {\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        try {\\n            NVPCallerServices caller = new NVPCallerServices();\\n            NVPProfile profile = new NVPProfile();\\n            \\n            // Set up your API credentials and environment\\n            profile.setAPIUsername(\"YOUR_API_USERNAME\");\\n            profile.setAPIPassword(\"YOUR_API_PASSWORD\");\\n            profile.setSignature(\"YOUR_API_SIGNATURE\");\\n            profile.setEnvironment(\"sandbox\"); // Use \"live\" for production\\n            \\n            caller.setProfile(profile);\\n            \\n            // Create a new API request\\n            NVPDecoder decoder = new NVPDecoder();\\n            NVPEncoder encoder = new NVPEncoder();\\n            encoder.add(\"METHOD\", \"SetExpressCheckout\");\\n            encoder.add(\"VERSION\", \"204\"); // Specify the version of the API you\\'re using\\n            encoder.add(\"PAYMENTREQUEST_0_AMT\", \"10.00\"); // Set checkout amount\\n            encoder.add(\"PAYMENTREQUEST_0_CURRENCYCODE\", \"USD\"); // Set currency\\n            encoder.add(\"RETURNURL\", \"http://yourwebsite.com/success\"); // Set return URL after payment\\n            encoder.add(\"CANCELURL\", \"http://yourwebsite.com/cancel\"); // Set cancel URL\\n            \\n            // Execute the API operation\\n            String strNVPRequest = encoder.encode();\\n            String strNVPResponse = caller.call(strNVPRequest);\\n            \\n            // Decode the response\\n            decoder.decode(strNVPResponse);\\n            \\n            if (\"Success\".equalsIgnoreCase(decoder.get(\"ACK\"))) {\\n                System.out.println(\"Checkout initiated successfully.\");\\n                // Extract token and redirect user for payment approval\\n                String token = decoder.get(\"TOKEN\");\\n                // Redirect to PayPal for approval\\n                String redirectURL = \"https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_express-checkout&token=\" + token;\\n                System.out.println(\"Redirect user to: \" + redirectURL);\\n            } else {\\n                System.out.println(\"Error: \" + decoder.get(\"L_LONGMESSAGE0\")); // Print error message\\n            }\\n            \\n        } catch (Exception e) {\\n            e.printStackTrace();\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Please note:**\\n- The actual PayPal Java SDK may have a different structure and class names.\\n- You need to replace `YOUR_API_USERNAME`, `YOUR_API_PASSWORD`, and `YOUR_API_SIGNATURE` with your actual PayPal API credentials.\\n- The URLs for `RETURNURL` and `CANCELURL` should point to the endpoints on your server that handle the post-checkout process.\\n- The version of the API (`\"VERSION\"`) should match the latest available version at the time of your integration.\\n\\n6. **Test Your Code**: Use the PayPal sandbox environment for testing your code. Make sure your program correctly handles the checkout process and error conditions.\\n\\n7. **Go Live**: After thorough testing, you can switch from the sandbox to the live environment by changing the environment parameter in your profile setup and using your live API credentials.\\n\\nRemember to review and follow PayPal\\'s API documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information when implementing your solution.')"

       "AIMessage(content='As the provided context only refers to the NVP/SOAP API and does not provide any specific Java code to be modified, I can\\'t give you exact changes to an existing codebase. However, I can guide you on how to transition from using the PayPal NVP/SOAP API to the PayPal REST API in a Java application.\\n\\n1. **Include PayPal REST API SDK**: To use the PayPal REST API, you\\'ll need to include the PayPal REST SDK for Java in your project. You can add the dependency to your project\\'s build file. For Maven, it would look something like this in your `pom.xml`:\\n\\n```xml\\n<dependency>\\n    <groupId>com.paypal.sdk</groupId>\\n    <artifactId>rest-api-sdk</artifactId>\\n    <version>1.14.0</version> <!-- Check for the latest version -->\\n</dependency>\\n```\\n\\n2. **Set up your PayPal environment**: You\\'ll need to configure the SDK with your client ID and secret, which you can get from the PayPal Developer Dashboard. Here’s how you might set up your environment:\\n\\n```java\\nimport com.paypal.base.rest.APIContext;\\nimport com.paypal.base.rest.OAuthTokenCredential;\\nimport com.paypal.base.rest.PayPalRESTException;\\n\\npublic class PayPalConfiguration {\\n    private static final String CLIENT_ID = \"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\";\\n    private static final String CLIENT_SECRET = \"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\";\\n    private static final String MODE = \"sandbox\"; // Use \"live\" for production\\n\\n    public static APIContext getAPIContext() throws PayPalRESTException {\\n        // Get an access token from PayPal\\n        String accessToken = new OAuthTokenCredential(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET)\\n                                 .getAccessToken();\\n        // Set up the APIContext with the access token\\n        return new APIContext(accessToken);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n3. **Create and execute PayPal REST API calls**: Use the SDK\\'s service classes to create and manage resources like payments, sales, and refunds. Here’s an example of creating a payment:\\n\\n```java\\nimport com.paypal.api.payments.*;\\nimport com.paypal.base.rest.PayPalRESTException;\\n\\npublic class PayPalPaymentService {\\n    \\n    public Payment createPayment(Double total, String currency, \\n                                 String method, String intent, \\n                                 String description, String cancelUrl, \\n                                 String successUrl) throws PayPalRESTException {\\n        // Set payment details\\n        Amount amount = new Amount();\\n        amount.setCurrency(currency);\\n        amount.setTotal(String.format(\"%.2f\", total));\\n\\n        Transaction transaction = new Transaction();\\n        transaction.setDescription(description);\\n        transaction.setAmount(amount);\\n\\n        // Set the payer and payment method\\n        Payer payer = new Payer();\\n        payer.setPaymentMethod(method);\\n\\n        // Create payment\\n        Payment payment = new Payment();\\n        payment.setIntent(intent);\\n        payment.setPayer(payer);\\n        payment.setTransactions(Arrays.asList(transaction));\\n\\n        // Set redirect URLs\\n        RedirectUrls redirectUrls = new RedirectUrls();\\n        redirectUrls.setCancelUrl(cancelUrl);\\n        redirectUrls.setReturnUrl(successUrl);\\n        payment.setRedirectUrls(redirectUrls);\\n\\n        // Execute API call\\n        APIContext apiContext = PayPalConfiguration.getAPIContext();\\n        return payment.create(apiContext);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n4. **Handle PayPal REST API responses**: Inspect the response from your API calls to handle success or errors accordingly.\\n\\n5. **Update your application logic**: Since REST APIs may have different workflows and operations than NVP/SOAP APIs, you\\'ll need to update your application logic to accommodate these changes.\\n\\nRemember to read through the PayPal REST API documentation for Java to understand the specifics of each API operation and how to handle them using the SDK. Also, ensure you replace placeholders like `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with your actual credentials from PayPal.')"
