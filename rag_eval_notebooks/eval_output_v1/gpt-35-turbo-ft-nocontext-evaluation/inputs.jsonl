You can configure Databricks to access data in ADLS Gen2 by mounting the storage account and then use the mounted path in your Spark jobs.","documents":"[]","question":"How to use run spark jobs and integrate with ADLS Gen2?","metrics":"gpt_groundedness,gpt_relevance,gpt_retrieval_score","line_number":43}
{"answer":"Batch inferencing in parallel mode involves processing multiple inference requests simultaneously, leveraging the available compute resources efficiently. This is achieved by distributing the inference requests across multiple compute nodes or cores, allowing for faster processing of the requests. Azure Machine Learning supports parallel batch inferencing by scaling out the compute resources based on the workload.","documents":"[]","question":"How does batch inferencing work in parallel mode?","metrics":"gpt_groundedness,gpt_relevance,gpt_retrieval_score","line_number":44}
{"answer":"To deploy a custom vision model to a real-time endpoint, you can use Azure Machine Learning's deployment capabilities. First, register your model, then create an inference configuration and deploy it as a web service. Would you like a detailed example or specific guidance on any of these steps?","documents":"[]","question":"How to deploy custom vision model to real time endpoint?","metrics":"gpt_groundedness,gpt_relevance,gpt_retrieval_score","line_number":45}
